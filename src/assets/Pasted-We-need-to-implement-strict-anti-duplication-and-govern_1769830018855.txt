We need to implement strict anti-duplication and governance rules for the Garage → Condominium feature.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT refactor unrelated features.
- Do NOT change existing UI styles unless required.
- Keep changes minimal and explicit.
- Preserve existing data when possible.
- Focus only on Condominium creation, validation, and reporting.

========================
1) CONDOMINIUM CREATION – ANTI DUPLICATION
========================

When a user attempts to create a new condominium, BEFORE saving:

Perform a uniqueness check using:
- Condominium name
- Address (street)
- Number
- ZIP code (CEP)

Normalization rules:
- Case-insensitive comparison
- Ignore accents and extra spaces

If a matching condominium already exists:
- Block the creation
- Show the existing condominium profile
- Display message:
  "Este condomínio já está cadastrado."
- Show button:
  "Entrar neste condomínio"

The user must NOT be allowed to create a duplicate condominium under any circumstance.

========================
2) CONDOMINIUM UNIQUE CODE
========================

When a condominium is successfully created:

- Generate a permanent, unique, alphanumeric code
- Example format:
  "CT-8F3K9A" or "COND-A72X9"
- The code must:
  - Be immutable
  - Be searchable
  - Be visible in the condominium profile

========================
3) CONDOMINIUM GOVERNANCE RULES
========================

- Users can NEVER delete a condominium.
- Users can NEVER edit critical data:
  - Name
  - Address
  - Number
  - CEP

Only the Cautoo admin team can:
- Delete a condominium
- Correct address or name
- Merge duplicate records (if any)

The user who creates the condominium:
- Is NOT an admin
- Has no special permissions

========================
4) CONDOMINIUM PROFILE – REPORT TO CAUTOO
========================

Inside every condominium profile, add a visible action button:

"Reportar à Cautoo"

When clicked, open a report form with:

Mandatory reason (single choice):
- Condomínio duplicado
- Endereço incorreto
- Nome incorreto
- Informações fraudulentas
- Solicitar atualização de dados

Mandatory description field:
- User must explain the issue

On submit:
- Save the report linked to:
  - Condominium ID
  - Reporting user
  - Timestamp
- Mark the condominium as "under review" (no UI change required yet)

========================
5) TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
========================

- Implement uniqueness validation at both:
  - Frontend (UX feedback)
  - Backend / service layer (hard validation)
- Prevent race conditions (double submit)
- Ensure condominium code uniqueness at database level
- Do NOT allow deletion via client-side logic

========================
6) DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS
========================

Before coding:
- Identify the exact files responsible for:
  - Condominium creation
  - Condominium profile view

After implementation:
- List all files changed
- Briefly describe what was changed in each file
- Ensure the app builds without errors
