We need to redesign the "Garage" feature in the Cautoo app.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT break existing features.
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code.
- Do NOT change UI style unless requested.
- Implement changes incrementally and safely.
- Preserve current database structure when possible.
- Add new logic only where necessary.

GOAL:
Transform the Garage feature into a condominium-based system instead of a global garage marketplace.

========================
1) FIRST ACCESS FLOW (EMPTY STATE)
========================

When the user accesses "Garage" for the first time and is not linked to any condominium:

Show an empty state with the message:
"You must be linked to a condominium to rent or offer a parking space."

Buttons:
- Search Condominium
- Create Condominium

========================
2) SEARCH CONDOMINIUM
========================

Allow users to search condominiums by:
- Name
- Address (city, neighborhood, street)

If a condominium exists:
- Display the condominium profile card
- Show button: "Join this condominium"

If not found:
- Show button: "Create new condominium"

IMPORTANT:
Prevent duplicate condominiums by name + address.
If a similar condominium exists, show the existing one instead of creating a new one.

========================
3) CREATE CONDOMINIUM
========================

Fields:
- Condominium name
- Type: Building or Houses
- Full address

RULE:
The user who creates the condominium is NOT an admin.
He is only the creator.

========================
4) CONDOMINIUM PROFILE
========================

After joining a condominium, the user can see:

- Condominium profile
- List of registered parking spaces
- Button: "Register my parking space"

========================
5) REGISTER PARKING SPACE
========================

Fields:
- Parking space identifier (e.g., 32B)
- Type: Covered / Uncovered
- Daily price
- Monthly price
- Availability status

RULE:
Only residents of the condominium can register parking spaces.

========================
6) RESERVATION FLOW
========================

Instead of searching globally, the user:

- Selects a condominium
- Selects a time period
- System shows available parking spaces for that period
- Shows prices
- User reserves the space

Reservation types:
- Resident
- Visitor

========================
7) VISITOR RESERVATION LINK
========================

When reserving for a visitor, generate a secure link containing:

- Condominium name
- Parking space info
- Owner of the space
- Person who made the reservation
- Vehicle plate
- Driver name
- Authorized period

The link must include buttons:
- Confirm parking usage (for gatekeeper)
- Report issue

========================
8) PAYMENT LOGIC (CAUCASH)
========================

Payments are made using CauCash credits.

Rules:
- User pays using CauCash balance
- Cautoo keeps 20% commission
- Parking owner receives 80%
- Payment is released only after the reservation period ends AND the renter confirms everything went well

========================
9) SECURITY AND REPORTS
========================

Rules:
- Only residents can rent or offer parking spaces in a condominium
- Residents can report suspicious or fake parking spaces
- If confirmed, the parking space is blocked and the user can be penalized

========================
10) TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
========================

- Implement this logic with minimal changes to existing architecture
- Create new services/controllers only when necessary
- Ensure data validation and anti-duplication logic
- Keep UI consistent with the current Cautoo design
- Ensure state management is stable and predictable

Before coding, analyze the current Garage implementation and explain what must be changed.
Then implement step by step.
